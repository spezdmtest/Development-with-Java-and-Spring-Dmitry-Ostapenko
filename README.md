RESTful shopping cart application

To implement a RESTful shopping cart application, the following specifications can be considered:

1. Adding Users:
- Users can register by providing their name, email, and password.
- Users can login to their account with their email and password.
- The system should perform authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

2. Adding Products:
- Products can be added to the system by an authorized user.
- Products should have a name, description, price, and quantity.
- The system should provide the ability to retrieve a list of all products or a single product by ID.

3. Adding Products to a Shopping Cart:
- An authorized user can add products to their shopping cart.
- The shopping cart should be associated with the user's account.
- The system should provide the ability to retrieve a list of all items in the user's shopping cart, update the quantity of items in the cart, and remove items from the cart.

Overall, the system should provide a RESTful API that conforms to standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for performing these actions. The API should also use authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources.
